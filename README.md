# No Free DLC Gear for theHunter: COTW

Adds a price to every purchasable unlocked by DLC: weapons, sights, binoculars and callers.
Made for those who don't want to feel like DLC is 'pay to win', given that the weapons in it are free in-game.

This mod is based on other existing 'No Free DLC stuff' mods, with small adjustments and additions to include the latest DLCs.

Credits:
This mod was made with 'Mod Builder - Revived' 2.2.6, which you can find here. Credit to WithoutWeakness for the awesome, easy to use tool.
